# Yagi-TM

Basically a four elements Yagi antenna equipped with extendable elements lenght and adjustable spacing.

The final [prototype](Definitive Antenna.stl) was able to cover from 120 MHz up to 900 MHz. <br>
Alternative extendable elements may be used to modify the frequency span.

This project was developed and tested for display at Maker Faire Rome 2019.
